# UnityTopDownShooter
A prototype fantasy top down shooter created in Unity for self-education purposes.

This prototype features a robust set of features, including:

An upgrade system

Animated main character, animated enemies

Health bar, mana bar

player movement, double jumping (first jump is space, second is right mouse click)

particle system that is fired when projectiles collide with enemies

a test level, one full level, one partially completed level

The prototype uses only free assets.

#Known Bugs
With the release of Unity 5.3.4 I had to upgrade the project, which caused a few strange bugs.
First, some of the buildings in level 2 appear with a pink hue, when before the upgrade they rendered correctly.

Second, the rocks used for platforming in level 4 do not move, whereas before the upgrade, if the player stood on them for long enough, the rock would fall. The player still falls, but the rock stays in its original position, creating an obvious visual bug.

#How To Run
Download the repository, extract it, and open it with Unity. After that it is simply a matter of navigating to the "Levels" folder in the Project Hierarchy and double clicking on the level you would like to test. Afterwards, click the play button, and the game should start. The latest version of Unity that this was tested on is v 5.3.4
